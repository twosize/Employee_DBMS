# Employee_DBMS

As a climax of the whole project, you will setup your own web sites including front-end and back-end designs at this part. Thanks to your efforts of previous parts, your backend database should be already up and running. Therefore, you will focus more on front-end e.g. user interface design and the interactions between the application and DBMS. Your user interface needn't be very fancy but must be clear and have the required functionalities.
1. [50] Basic functionality: your application must support basic database operations such as looking-up, inserting, deleting, and updating. All these must be implemented in your application program and interact with the database through ODBC or JDBC.

2. [20] Web based: users can access your database on line from a web browser. You can implement it using PHP/WAMP/MAMP/LAMP (or Java servlets, MS SQL server, etc.).

3. [20] Error checking: your application should be robust enough against bad inputs. For example, a ssn must be exactly 9 digits etc. Is the checking done by application or by database? Explain the trade-offs and give examples of by both.

4. [10] Referential integrity constraint:  let the user see the available input values at runtime (e.g. an existing ssn) during insertion and cascade deletes.

At the end, you will have a short demo of what you have done in the web application.
